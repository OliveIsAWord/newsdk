In order to develop the MINTIA operating system, an easy way to create a disk
image for testing, and to update its contents as system components are rebuilt,
is required. The XR Disk Update Tool (XRDUT) must fulfill these requirements.

For the build tool it must, in a single invocation (for efficiency):
  o  Be able to create a blank disk image of a given size.

  o  Give the disk a simple partition map (for now APT support only, but GPT
     and EFI System Partition support will appear during the AMD64 port, so it
     should be generic enough to easily slide that in later).

  o  Write a boot sector to the disk if applicable.

  o  Format the root partition as AisixFS (while being generic enough to allow
     other filesystems, such as the to-be-designed MintyFS, later).

  o  Initialize the filesystem structure of the root partition from a "manifest"
     file which specifies a list of host directory subtrees to be copied into
     the image, along with UID and GID for the files in the destination subtree.

In another invocation it must:
  o  Update any specified files given by a file containing a newline-delineated
     list.

For user usage it must:
  o  Allow generic information about a disk image such as partition entries,
     filesystem type, etc to be printed.

  o  Allow a manifest file to be provided and to iterate over all of the files
     in each directory subtree it specifies, and to update each file with a
     modification time later than that of the matching file within the disk
     image.

The format of a manifest file is a sequence of lines of this form:

    <base path within disk image> <source subtree path> <uid gid>

E.g.:

    /Mintia ./TestBase/Mintia 0 0
    /Home/Guest ./TestBase/Home/Guest 50 50
