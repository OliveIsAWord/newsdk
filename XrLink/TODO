- Test the dynamic linking functionality (such as jump stub generation) since it
  is completely untested currently due to having no dynamically linked
  environment to run it in yet.

- Sort the symbol table by virtual address of the symbol to allow faster reverse
  lookup of virtaddr -> symbol for stack traces and such.

  XXX This seems to already magically happen as a result of symbols only being
      created in ascending order within each section by the assembler, and each
      linked module ending up in order within the output module. If any of these
      assumptions change we WILL need explicit symbol table sorting.
