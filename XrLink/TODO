- Test the dynamic linking functionality (such as jump stub generation) since it
  is completely untested currently due to having no dynamically linked
  environment to run it in yet.

- Finish dumping info about import table and fixups of imports which is
  incomplete due to having no object files to test with yet.

- Sort the symbol table by virtual address of the symbol to allow faster reverse
  lookup of virtaddr -> symbol for stack traces and such.
