	// The lexer found a preprocessor directive and called us to handle it.
	// Until we return, we are in full control of the source stream, and can
	// consume it, tokenize it, etc to our hearts content. Thanks to the
	// layered nature of the lexer, we don't have to worry about maintaining
	// line numbers and so on.
