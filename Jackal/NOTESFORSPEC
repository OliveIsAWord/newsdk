1. Local variables cannot have their addresses taken, unless it's an array or
   compound type.

2. Local "datum" variable (i.e. non-compound, non-array) types are hints and you
   shouldn't rely on wrapping, as they will probably be placed in machine
   registers and there will be no effort taken to keep them within e.g. UBYTE
   bounds of 0-255 and so on. This also applies to arguments passed to function
   calls, return values, and OUT parameters. The variable will only be
   "at least" as large as that type.

3. One way to achieve either of the above is to declare it as an array and take
   the address of an element.
